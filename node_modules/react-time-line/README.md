**Installation**
```
npm install react-time-line
```


**Usage**

```javascript
const events = [
  {ts: "2017-09-17T12:22:46.587Z", text: 'Logged in'},
  {ts: "2017-09-17T12:21:46.587Z", text: 'Clicked Home Page'},
  {ts: "2017-09-17T12:20:46.587Z", text: 'Edited Profile'},
  {ts: "2017-09-16T12:22:46.587Z", text: 'Registred'},
  {ts: "2017-09-16T12:21:46.587Z", text: 'Clicked Cart'},
  {ts: "2017-09-16T12:20:46.587Z", text: 'Clicked Checkout'},
];

<Timeline items={events} />
```
The events should be ordered in a way you need.


**Style**

Currently there is no proper way to set the style. As a hack you can override the default style. Check for the default style in `src/style.scss`.
